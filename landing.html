  <h1>Jake Chustz: Programmer-In-Training</h1>
    <p>Jake grew up in sunny Southern California. He attended the Orange County School of the Arts where he studied voice, acting, and commericial dance. 
      He then went on to work in the cruise, entertainment, hospitality, medical and orthodontic industries. He studied briefly at Orange Coast College 
      putting credits toward transfer and is looking to complete his degree in the future. Jake has had a love for technology since he was a kid, and now
      he can finally bring that love to life. A career in tech will allow him to grow, stay creative, and give him the means to make music. His favorite part
      about programming is that there's always something to learn. He's excited to pursue a career that will push him to be his best.</p>
